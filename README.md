## Introduction and Purpose :wave: :v: [top](#ccnp-encor-study-computer-desktop_computer-floppy_disk)

Please be aware this is NOT the best study method in the world! Far from it! Everyone learns in different ways and this is just what has worked for me on my journey. I hope you enjoy and maybe grab even one thing from this document that may assist you in your certification journey.

Some small background on me. I've been working in networking for about 9 years. I obtained the old CCNP R/S a few years ago. I wanted to take on the challenge of the new exams after the "Certpocalypse" with the added blueprint points. As well as freshen up my own knowledge as I don't use everything in the blueprint in my day to day role.

### Official Certification Guide :blue_book: :thumbsup: [top](#ccnp-encor-study-computer-desktop_computer-floppy_disk)

[CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core ENCOR 350-401 Official Cert Guide](https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccnp-and-ccie-enterprise-core-encor-350-401-official-9781587145230)

In any certification tackled, I always start with the source. Cisco Press books can be up and down and the CCNP ENCOR book is no exception. I would recommend checking out the errata on the Cisco Press site and making all necessary corrections.

I'm a weirdo and read the book front to back. Call me old school! I think the OCGs tend to give you a fairly strong base towards passing the exam but I don't believe this alone will allow you to pass the exam.

I usually plan a set target on what I would like to accomplish that day or week with the book. If its a heavy topic like STP which spans multiple chapters, I may give myself a week to fully digest the material. Making sure to read all of the chapters and answer the questions at the start of every chapter. I will pay more attention around the question topics missed during the chapter reading. I am not a big fan of notes as I don't believe that helps me retain knowledge very well. More on that later.

### Lab, Lab, Lab :man_technologist: :woman_technologist: :computer: :keyboard: :computer_mouse:

You do not have to lab to pass this exam.... BUT you will be doing yourself a disservice by not labbing. I will bet many of us learn by doing and I am no different. At the end of the day we are not only learning to pass an exam but to become great engineers. Getting on the keys, building topologies, and thinking about design is all part of the path.

I dont want to push a particular labbing setup. Whether you decide to build a physical lab or something virtual. It all has pros and cons... or what the fancy engineers would say "tradeoffs". A lot of great Cisco gear can be purchased online for relatively low cost. Ill link a few virtual options below.

- [EVE-NG](https://www.eve-ng.net/)
- [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/)
- [CML](https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/cisco-modeling-labs-personal/cisco-cml-personal)

Ill give you an example on how I would lab. Lets say we're reading through the OCG and they give us this great topology on VTP!

The rest of the book would walk the reader through VTP server vs client vs transparent modes. Reading is just part of the battle. Labbing as I read the book greatly helps me retain the information and really get the commands down! If you do not have a reference topology to start from just build it! Mess around with the lab and break it.. then fix it! Even better! Below is just a snippet from when I created the lab virtually.

### Anki Flashcards :sparkler::thumbsup: :thumbsup: :thumbsup: :sparkler: [top](#ccnp-encor-study-computer-desktop_computer-floppy_disk)

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

Remember before how I said I'm not the biggest fan on taking notes for retaining information? Well I am a fan of making flash cards! The current deck I have for ENCOR is just under 1000 cards. Don't let that number scare you. Everyone learns differently and you may need way less cards than that or more in some cases. Anki, the free program I use, utilizes learning principles called spaced repetition and active recall, both proven to help folks learning a topic. Basically, space out the learning on a subject in timed intervals and test the mind to recall the information. Check out these videos by Ali Abdaal for more information :arrow_right: [Active Recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE&t=878s&ab_channel=AliAbdaal) and [Spaced Repetition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zNHHpXoMM&list=PL7BImOT2srcEPwr4hSVrqvWYh1SV7LBEx&index=6&ab_channel=AliAbdaal)

The time required to make and practice flash cards is so small in the grand scheme of things but the returns are incredible. In my day to day, even with 900+ flashcards. At most I will be assigned around 70 per day and my daily average sits at 60. The total time it could take me to run through these flashcards is maybe 20 mins. These flashcards will take some imagination to really make things stick. Let me give you a few examples and maybe they can be a guide for you on how creative you can be.

![Anki Main Interface](/images/anki_display.PNG)

Lets pretend I just hit the `Add` button above. This is probably how a lot of my cards started and they are perfectly fine for quick info based scenarios. 

![Anki Cloze Beginner](/images/anki_bgp_cloze.PNG)

Here is what looks like when I am prompted with the card.

![Anki BGP Question](/images/anki_bgp_question.PNG)

Here is what it looks like on review. Now if you got it wrong hit the red button. If its okay hit the green one for later review. If it was so quick in your mind, hit the big blue button!

![Anki BGP Answer](/images/anki_bgp_answer.PNG)

Ill add some more examples under the [anki_examples](/anki_examples) folder.

#### Anki Add-ons :fire: :fire: :fire: :world_map: :brain: [top](#ccnp-encor-study-computer-desktop_computer-floppy_disk)

Really small segment on add ons. Anki supports add-ons for the web version to extend its functionality.

[Review Heatmap](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1771074083), all of the shades of red seen in the first Anki image. Heatmap allows you to have a big picture idea on your study history and your upcoming reviews. It allows you to see reviews performed that day, study history, daily averages and more.

[Image Occlusion](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155) makes it incredibly easy to make cards from tables of information and very quickly. This one is better with an example. Lets say I'm reading through the OCG and this awesome table comes up about routing protocol ADs.

![Routing AD](/images/routing.PNG)

While that image is copied in my buffer, I can create a new Anki card and hit this little button.

![Image Occlusion Button](/images/occlusion_button.PNG)

That will bring up the Image Occlusion add mode, I've tried to highlight the most important options. Basically cover up the answers and click `Hide All, Guess One` at the bottom! This will add 10 flashcards to your deck. It may look like a long process but in practice its really very quick.

![Occlusion Add](/images/occlusion_add.PNG)

This is what it would look like when reviewing a card created my Image Occlusion.
